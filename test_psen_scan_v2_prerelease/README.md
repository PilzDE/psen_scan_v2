# PILZ safety laser scanner PSENscan

## Package: test_psen_scan_v2_prerelease

The `test_psen_scan_v2_prerelease` package tests the external API and launch file of the `psen_scan_v2` package.
Since all unit and integration tests within a single package are run in devel space by catkin, we need another
package to test the install space to make sure all files work as expected in the public installation.
